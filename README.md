### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up –d
```
3. Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

4. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:
* **RabbitMQ -> http://localhost:15672/**
* **Catalog API -> http://localhost:8000/swagger/index.html**
* **Basket API -> http://localhost:8001/swagger/index.html**
* **Order API -> http://localhost:8002/swagger/index.html**
* **API Gateway -> http://localhost:7000/Order?username=swn**
* **Web UI -> http://localhost:8003/**

5. Launch http://localhost:8003/ in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to **call microservices over API Gateway**. When you **checkout the basket** you can follow **queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard**.
